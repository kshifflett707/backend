To make it easier I thought of loading these DataTables into a DataSet and then extracting them at the server end.

This means our case for a valid filename is:\n\n\nAlphanumeric\nCan include single slashes of either direction\nCan include single dots but not pairs.\n\n\nSo \"APP-TEST-file.20161115.1\" is valid but \"/../../test//\\\" needs to have some characters removed prior to checking the filesystem.\n\nHere's the regex I've got now, unfortunately it's removing too much.\n\npublic static String validateFilePath(String fileName) {\n    return fileName.replaceAll(\"[^A-Za-z0-9]+[(\\\\.\\\\/)\\\\+2]\", \"\");\n}\n\n\nSuch that \"APP-TEST-file.20161115.1\" is becoming  \"APP-TEST-file0161115.1\"\n\nAny help would be appriciated.\n    ","title":"Regex that removes all non-alphanumeric, single periods, and single slashes","id":13,"PostTypeId":1,"bounty":0.16547360346665618,"UserId":11,"viewCount":5,"upvoteCount":11,"comments":1},{"body":"\nDo you want something like this?

This webservice is mainly consumed by other software. The other software runs on some smallish linux devices. These devices will continue to increase as the lifetime of the product increases. \n\nSince I want the entire product to be plug and play and I want to be able to send my customers new devices which will be able to authenticate automatically and who don't have to be configured in any way by my customers at all. \n\nI could achieve something like that with just a static api key but really If there is a leak even once the entire system is compromised...\n\nThe next idea I had would be to automatically generate a new api-key every week and send it the existing clients and I would just have to put this api-key into the hardware I would send my customers. But this has 2 issues. Some devices might not be available for more than 1 week so it could miss an api-key update. \nNew devices might not be connected for 1 week. \n\nI am thinking that maybe I could generate api keys based on some specific datetime each week so I have an algorithm on the client and server that generate the key and use that. But I fear that this might be reverse engineered in some way.\n\nI am close to a total beginner in security so any help would be appreciated!\n\nMy server software stack is c# and most of my clients will be python but other languages are possible.\n    ","title":"Authenticate list of growing devices forever","id":15,"PostTypeId":1,"bounty":0.8995703277570699,"UserId":70,"viewCount":4,"upvoteCount":29,"comments":0},{"body":"\n\nUpdate after making changes:\n\n/app/index.js:27\n2016-12-07T16:03:32.984832+00:00 app[web.1]:   liveQuery: {\n2016-12-07T16:03:32.984833+00:00 app[web.1]:   ^^^^^^^^^\n2016-12-07T16:03:32.984838+00:00 app[web.1]: SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier\n2016-12-07T16:03:32.984839+00:00 app[web.1]:     at Object.exports.runInThisContext (vm.js:76:16)\n2016-12-07T16:03:32.984839+00:00 app[web.1]:     at Module._compile (module.js:542:28)\n2016-12-07T16:03:32.984840+00:00 app[web.1]:     at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:579:10)\n2016-12-07T16:03:32.984840+00:00 app[web.1]:     at Module.load (module.js:487:32)\n2016-12-07T16:03:32.984840+00:00 app[web.1]:     at tryModuleLoad (module.js:446:12)\n2016-12-07T16:03:32.984841+00:00 app[web.1]:     at Function.Module._load (module.js:438:3)\n2016-12-07T16:03:32.984842+00:00 app[web.1]:     at Module.runMain (module.js:604:10)\n2016-12-07T16:03:32.984842+00:00 app[web.1]:     at run (bootstrap_node.js:394:7)\n2016-12-07T16:03:32.984842+00:00 app[web.1]:     at startup (bootstrap_node.js:149:9)\n2016-12-07T16:03:32.984843+00:00 app[web.1]:     at bootstrap_node.js:509:3\n2016-12-07T16:03:32.991077+00:00 app[web.1]: \n2016-12-07T16:03:32.998460+00:00 app[web.1]: npm ERR!

When a remote\n  notification cannot be delivered because the intended app does not\n  exist on the device, the feedback service adds that device’s token to\n  its list. Remote notifications that expire before being delivered are\n  not considered a failed delivery and don’t impact the feedback\n  service. By using this information to stop sending remote\n  notifications that will fail to be delivered, you reduce unnecessary\n  message overhead and improve overall system performance.\n\n\nFeedBack Service payload\n\nSo \"Feedback Service\" essentially give us a token list for failed push notifications. I tried to send push to a device with disabled push notification permission or app uninstalled , however my device token does not appear in this list.\n\nApple's document also mentions we will get immediate response from APN once we send the push notification:\n\n\n  If you send a notification that is accepted by APNs, nothing is\n  returned. If you send a notification that is malformed or otherwise\n  unintelligible, APNs returns an error-response packet and closes the\n  connection. Any notifications that you sent after the malformed\n  notification using the same connection are discarded, and must be\n  resent. Figure A-2 shows the format of the error-response packet.\n\n\nHowever, it seems like the returned status stays the same no matter what I do: enable/disable push notification permission or even uninstall the app...\n\nI fact, my hypothesis is that even the user has disabled the push notification, APN will still see it as a successful delivery, but iOS just simply don't show it.  None of them response code from APN seem to be related to the disabled push notification. \n\nI am wondering if there is a way to do it with APN?

The server is now done.  \n\nAJAX gives you the means to call back to the server and have it do more processing for you.  The cycle is:\n\n\nAJAX posts back to the server\nServer receives the request\nYou check the nonce to make sure it's a valid request\nThen you do some processing\nPackage up the return and send it back to the request\nYour script receives the response and continues.\n\n\nIn your case, you make the call back to the server with $.post. WordPress receives the request and then fires 2 events:\n\n\nwp_ajax_{your ajax action}\nwp_ajax_nopriv_{your ajax action}\n\n\nThe first event fires and gives access if the user is logged in.  The second one (i.e. nopriv) fires regardless if they are logged in or not.\n\nWordPress then runs your callback that you registered to the above event names.  Your example callback is blog_post_data_fetch().\n\nNow in your code, you need to add nonce check to keep it safe. If that passes, then you can process the request.

In case of multiple inputs there are also input threads for demuxing (1 thread per input); for single input demuxing is done on main thread.\n\nSetting \"threads N\" (where N > 1) on input enables multithreaded decoding which can spawn N additional threads for each decoder which supports it. In your case video decoder supports it and audio decoder doesn't so it is 3 threads - 1 main thread + 2 threads for video decoding.\n\nSimilarly, setting \"threads N\" on output enables multithreaded filtering and encoding which can spawn N additional threads for each filtergraph (I think in older ffmpeg versions this was \"up to N threads per each filter\") and each encoder which supports it. There is also one important caveat - this only applies to encoders which do their thread management via ffmpeg; libx264 doesn't do that - it forwards requested thread count to the x264 library which does its own thread management. x264 then might create up to 2*N threads (exact number depends on many encoding parameters). So for \"threads 2\" with single output you'll get 1 main thread + 2 threads for the scaler + at least 2 threads for libx264. This still doesn't add up to num_outputs * (1 + num_threads) behaviour you are seeing and I'd be interested to learn where additional threads come from but hopefully my answer explains why \"threads 2\" option doesn't increase thread count by 2.\n    ","id":124,"PostTypeId":2,"PostId":123,"bounty":0.3729963591639047,"UserId":47,"upvoteCount":38},{"body":"\n\nI am using Visual Studio to create an asp.net web application in C# and am having issues trying to insert data from one of my pages into a table in a SQL Server database.

And you don't need to modify the d attribute for paths either.\n\nAll you need to do to move any element is apply a translate transform. Ie:\n\n<path ... transform=\"translate(20, 20)\">\n\n\nIn Snap you can use the Element.transform() function to apply a transform.\n\nHere's a demo where I move each path towards the pointer a little bit every time you move the pointer.\n\nfunction moveFunc( ev, x, y ) {\n    //console.log(ev);\n    paths.forEach(function(el) {\n       // Convert screen mouse coords to the equivalent point in SVG coords\n       var pt = cursorPoint(x, y);\n       // Get the \"center\" of each path by way of its bounding box\n       var b = el.getBBox();\n       var cx = b.x + b.width/2;\n       var cy = b.y + b.height/2;\n       // Get the direction vector from the path center to the pointer location\n       var dx = pt.x - cx;\n       var dy = pt.y - cy;\n       // Get the current transform (if any) on the path\n       var currentTransform = el.transform().localMatrix;\n       // Add the tranlation that moves the paths a little toward the pointer\n       currentTransform = currentTransform.translate(dx/20, dy/20);\n       el.transform(currentTransform);\n    });\n}\n\n\n// Convert a screen space coordinate to an SVG coordinate\nfunction cursorPoint(x, y) {\n  var svg = s.node;\n  var pt = svg.createSVGPoint();\n  pt.x = x;  pt.y = y;\n  return pt.matrixTransform(svg.getScreenCTM().inverse());\n}\n\n\nHopefully this is enough to get you started.  To move the <polygon> points, you'll need to get the array of points and then update each point in the array by adding dx,dy.\n\nYou can get the points of a polygon using el.node.points.\n\nGood luck!\n    ","id":135,"PostTypeId":2,"PostId":134,"bounty":0.8328579702747156,"UserId":97,"upvoteCount":34},{"body":"\n\nI have a User model with a matches field that is of :map type.

The reason is that the compiler cannot know, when compiling one translation unit, how many derived classes are in other translation units, or in which order you will link them.\n\nEven worse, you might decide to put some object files containing derived classes into a dynamic library that you load at runtime. In that case, the total number of derived classes may change during the run time of the program. And again, there is no way for the compiler to determine if that is the case.\n\nSo in short, what you are seeing is not a specific shortcoming of the C++ language, but a fundamental restriction of the separate compilation model.

You\nmay assume there will be less than 50 items and each recipe will use less than 50 other items to create a\nfinal product.\"\n\nThis is the items1.txt we use \n\nItem: Wood 2.5\nItem: Metal 5.5\nItem: Cat 900\nItem: Spear 50.7\nRecipe: Spear = Wood + Wood + Metal ;\n\n\nI have what I think would work but I can't get a certain line to work.

That way, when something doesn't work, you know it's in the last few lines you added. Otherwise, you get to 200 lines of code and not much clue where the error lies.\n\nProgram changes\n\nThis code hasn't been designed for debugging or maintenance; you should fix those problems before you go on.  Most of all, you've created two sets of input that perform one task (get the user's move) and then four blocks of code that perform the same task (move the user).\n\nInstead, find some usable wording that will have the player enter the move on one line.  You turn that into movement coordinates (such as [1, -2] for \"up one and left two\"), and then use a single block of code to move through the grid.  Instead of testing four blocks of code, you test one; when you need to make a change, you make one change, not four copies under rotation and reflection.\n\nResult\nThe code you live with should look more like this:\n\ndef get_move():\n    advice  = \"Please enter your move in two integers:\\n\" +\n              \"vertical, then horizontal.  Use positive numbers\\n\" +\n              \"for up and right, negative for down and left.\\n\"\n    example = \"For instance, the line \\n\\t2 -1\\n\" +\n              \"   is 2 spaces up, one space left.\"\n    move = input(advice + example).split\n    x_move = int(move[0])\n    y_move = int(move[1])\n    # Here, you check move legality; repeat until you get a legal move\n\n    return x_move, y_move\n\nwhile True:\n    print_board()\n    x_move, y_move = get_move()    # get_move contains the input interaction and data checking\n    move(x_move, y_move)  # perform the move; update the board.\n\n\nAlso note that you should probably update the existing board, rather than (apparently) creating a new one for every move.

Confusing, but it makes sense!\n\nThink of a Map like a dictionary. You can store pairs in it. In scala, you can add/update a key/value pair by adding a pair to it.\nMap(b -> 4) + (\"c\" -> 2) would return Map(b -> 4, c -> 2). Expanding on that, Map(b -> 4, c -> 2) + (\"b\" -> 1) returns Map(b -> 1, c -> 2). What acc is (renamed from count for clarity) is the accumulator of a growing object as the iterator is folded. Each time it hits a new row, it is checking to see if that row has is in the Map yet (again, think dictionary). If the value is there, it takes the previous value with getOrElse and adds 1 to it, then updates the acc Map with that new pair, or it initializes it at one if it doesn't exist yet (since it was the first time the row was seen).\n\nHere is the best blog I found for learning folding.

Here is a small example: \n\n\n\nVue.component('child-component', {\n  template: '#child-component'\n});\n\nnew Vue({\n  el: '#app',\n  data: { message: 'Hello I have been slotted' }\n});\n  \n<script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/vue/2.1.4/vue.js\"></script>\n<div id=\"app\">\n  <child-component>\n    {{ message }}\n  </child-component>\n</div>\n\n<template id=\"child-component\">\n  <div>\n    <p>Above the slot</p>\n    <slot></slot>\n    <p>Below the slot</p>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n\n\n\nEssentially, any html between the component tags gets put into the slot. You can read more about slots in the documentation here.\n\nThe Problem\n\nYou have tried to slot three moustache components into moustaches, but moustaches doesn't have a slot. \n\nAlso, you have given the moustache components slots, but haven't slotted anything in.\n\nSolution #1\n\nAdd a slot to the moustaches component. Because the moustache components are empty divs, they will not  show up on the page. Here is a working code snippet:\n\n\n\nVue.component('moustaches', {\n  template: '#moustaches',\n  data() {\n    return { moustaches: [] };\n  },\n  created() {\n    this.moustaches = this.$children;\n  }\n});\n\nVue.component('moustache', {\n  template: '<div><slot></slot></div>',\n\n  props: {\n    name: { required: true },\n    img: { required: true},\n    selected: { default: false }\n  }\n\n});\n\nnew Vue({\n  el: '#app'\n});\n<script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/vue/2.1.4/vue.js\"></script>\n\n<div id=\"app\">\n  <moustaches>\n    <moustache name=\"The Burgundy\" img=\"/img/the-burgundy.jpg\"></moustache>\n    <moustache name=\"The Borat\" img=\"/img/the-borat.jpg\"></moustache>\n    <moustache name=\"The Santana\" img=\"/img/the-santana.jpg\"></moustache>\n  </moustaches>\n</div>\n\n<template id=\"moustaches\">\n  <div>\n    <ul class=\"list-inline\">\n      <li v-for=\"moustache in moustaches\">\n        <p>\n          <strong>@{{ moustache.name }}</strong>\n        </p>\n        <img width=\"300\" height=\"200\" :src=\"moustache.img\">\n        <button \n                class=\"btn btn-primary\" \n                :data-type=\"moustache.name\"\n                >\n          Vote\n        </button>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <slot></slot>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n\n\n\nI do not recommend this approach, because you are using the slot only to pass data. Slots should be used to pass html, not data. It is a strange way of doing things and you'll likely run into other bugs.\n\nSolution #2\n\nInstead of using a slot to pass data, you should be passing data via props.

At the moment, my goal is to read expressions made up of integers, strings, and their operators. The integers work well - the problem is with the strings. After I run the program, when I type a string into the console, it's supposed to print back the result of the expression - in this case that it's a string type, followed by the value of the string. So if I type \"hello\", I'm supposed to get back \"it:String=\"hello\"\". The problem is that at my LAST reduction in the bison file (where bison uses one of the start variable's rules to reduce to the start variable), the string value somehow gains a newline at the end of it. So the string ends up being \"hello\\n\", and so it:String=\"hello\"\\n is printed to the console.

Is this done in a trigger on oracle on that table or on the side of my JDBC client?\n\nAny clarification would be nice! \n\nThanks\n    ","title":"Implementing Optimistic Locking in Oracle","id":291,"PostTypeId":1,"bounty":0.6858914086784043,"UserId":34,"viewCount":2,"upvoteCount":9,"comments":1},{"body":"\nThere are two general approaches to locking.\n\nFirst, you have pessimistic locking.  In this approach, you lock the row (SELECT ... FOR UPDATE) which prevents anyone else from changing the row.  Then you do the UPDATE.  When you commit your change, the lock is released.  There is no need in this case to have a version number/ timestamp column (at least not to support locking) and the code is relatively easy.  \n\nThe downside to pessimistic locking is that you need to hold the lock the entire time a user is sitting on a page potentially editing data.  This is technically really hard if you're building a web-based application since HTTP is a stateless protocol.  The request that initially renders the page would normally get a connection from the connection pool, do the SELECT, and then return the connection to the pool once the page was done.  The subsequent request to update the data would generally happen on a different connection with a different database session so you can't lock the row in the first session and update it in the second.  If you wanted to pessimistically lock the row, you'd need to do a lot of work on the back end to ensure that the one database connection was tied to a particular middle tier session until the user was done editing the data.  This generally has very negative impacts on scalability and introduces all sorts of session management problems-- how do you know, for example, whether I requested a page, locking a row, and then closed my browser without ever logging out or making a change?  How long are you going to leave the record locked in the database?  What happens if some other session is trying to lock the row?  How long are you going to let that session block waiting for a lock if the first person went out to lunch?  Generally, people don't implement pessimistic locking in web-based apps because managing sessions and session state is just too impractical.\n\nThe second option is optimistic locking.  In this approach, you add a version number/ timestamp to the row.  You select this version number/ timestamp when you query the data.  Then you use this in your WHERE clause when you later do the update and check how many rows were actually modified.  If you modify exactly one row, you know the row hasn't changed since you read it.  If you modify 0 rows, you know that the row did change and you can handle the error.\n\nSo, for example, you'd select the data along with the version number\n\nSELECT address_line1, city, state, zip, version\n  FROM addressTable\n WHERE address_id = `<<some key>>`\n\n\nWhen you were ready to do the update, you'd do something like this where you use the version in your UPDATE and throw an error if the row changed\n\nUPDATE addressTable\n   SET address_line1 = `<<new address line 1>>`,\n       city = `<<new city>>`,\n       state = `<<new state>>`,\n       zip = `<<new zip>>`,\n       version = version + 1\n WHERE address_id = `<<some key>>`\n   AND version = `<<version you read initially>>`\n\nIF( SQL%ROWCOUNT = 0 )\nTHEN\n  -- Darn.  The row must have changed since you read it.  Do something to\n  -- alert the user.  Most likely, the application will need to re-query the\n  -- data to see what the address has been changed to and then ask the user\n  -- whether they want to re-apply the changes.\n  RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR( -20001, 'Oops, the row has changed since you read it.' );\nEND;\n\n\nYour application would then do something useful with the error.  Normally, that would mean doing something like querying the data again, presenting the changes to the user, and asking them whether they still wanted to apply their changes.  If, for example, I read an address and start editing it, go to lunch, my colleague logs in, reads the same address, makes some edits and saves it, then I return and try to save my changes, it would generally make sense to show me something telling me that my colleague already changed the address to something new-- do I want to continue making edits or do I want to abandon them.\n    ","id":292,"PostTypeId":2,"PostId":291,"bounty":0.6858914086784043,"UserId":52,"upvoteCount":10},{"body":"\n\nI have a linear gradient with red at the top going to white at the bottom in my footer CSS.

I'd like to aggregate the statuses on the requests so that a request set has a status that is determined from the state of its individual requests.\n\nThe relevant parts of these domain classes look like this:\n\nclass RequestSet {\n    Long id\n    static hasMany = [requests: Request]\n}\n\nclass Request {\n    Long id\n    Status status\n}\n\nclass Status {\n    Long id\n    String status\n}\n\n\nI tried adding a derived status property to the RequestSet class like so:\n\nclass RequestSet {\n    Long id\n    Status status\n    static hasMany = [requests: Request]\n\n    static transients = ['status']\n\n    static mapping = {\n        status formula: '(SELECT MIN(status_id) FROM (SELECT status_id FROM request rq WHERE rq.request_set_id = id))'\n    }\n}\n\n\nWhen I run my app and inspect the properties of the requestSet objects, however, the statuses are all null.\n\nIs what I'm trying to accomplish even possible using derived properties? I could settle for a transient property with a getter but I'd like to be able to use dynamic finders to retrieve requestSets based on their bubbled-up statuses. All the examples I've seen use the result of the formula as is; I'd like to know if I can somehow get Grails to interpret the returned value as an ID for the Status class.\n\nEDIT, 7 Dec 2016: Note that I marked the derived status property as transient.

I'll settle for using the formula to compute the id of the status but I'm still having issues with that.\n\nNow my domain class looks like this:\n\nclass RequestSet {\n    Long id\n    Long statusId\n    static hasMany = [requests: Request]\n\n    static mapping = {\n        statusId formula: '(SELECT MIN(status_id) FROM (SELECT rq.status_id FROM request rq WHERE rq.request_set_id = id))'\n    }\n}\n\n\nThe SQL generated by the formula when fetching the request sets is\n\n(SELECT MIN(this_.status_id) FROM (SELECT rq.status_id FROM request rq WHERE rq.request_set_id = this_.id)) as formula3_0_ from request_set\n\n\nand I'm getting an SQLSyntaxErrorException: ORA-00904: \"THIS_\".\"STATUS_ID\": invalid identifier.

It takes only C or C++ source code as input. The assembler is MASM (ml.exe).\nThe assembly-code output of cl.exe cannot, in general, be fed directly into MASM. In some cases, it is not even valid assembly code. In other cases, there are directives, keywords, and other things emitted in the code that MASM doesn't directly support. Things get especially hairy if the C/C++ source uses exceptions. The listing file is for informational purposes only.\n\n\nIt is very unclear to me why you are even wanting to do this in the first place. If your source code is either C or C++, and can be compiled and linked by MSVC, then what is the point of introducing the additional intermediate step of converting it to and from assembly language? Just use cl.exe directly to make a DLL.\n\nIf you absolutely must do this, you will have to take the ASM listing file generated by MSVC and manually clean it up before running it through MASM. You can make this clean-up task easier by turning off whole program optimization, turning off exception handling, turning off security checks/cookies, and indicating to the linker that the image does not contain safe SEH handlers. Note that some of these may break or change the behavior of your code! You'll also need to add EXTERN definitions for functions that you call from runtime libraries.\n    ","id":381,"PostTypeId":2,"PostId":380,"bounty":0.17416304484641754,"UserId":64,"upvoteCount":38},{"body":"\nWhile ASM source generated by the Microsoft C compiler might not be the best input back into MASM, that doesn't mean it won't work, at least in some cases (just maybe not complicated ones). If you look at an ASM file generated by the C compiler, you'll find someone at Microsoft went to a lot of trouble to insert various \"hacky\" includes, directives, manual segment definitions and other MASM specifics to give the source file at least a slim chance of being fed back into MASM and achieving an assembled result.  As long as you set your expectations low, I'd guess a simple C source file, converted to ASM and then fed back into MASM should work if you get your command lines options in order.\n\nOne caveat you need to keep in mind is that if you use the CRT like you are doing (i.e. the use of memcmp), you'll want to allow the default entrypoint ___DllMainCRTStartup@12 to be selected from the appropriate CRT .LIB file  rather than specifying your own.  This allows the CRT to be initialized before your DllMain is called, preventing a crash when you invoke certain CRT functions that depend on this initialization. With that said, older versions of Visual Studio, such as 7.1 (2003), you could get away with not initializing the CRT depending on the which functions you used without risking a crash.  The newer versions of the C Runtime will throw an exception no matter which CRT function is called if the process has not previously called mainCRTStarttup or DllMainCRTStartup.\n\nFor educational purposes, lets address the entrypoint problem you described above using MSVC 7.1 (2003) and we'll not worry about initializing the CRT so you can explicitly specify your own entrypoint.  I think you were hitting the following linker warning:\n\nwarning LNK4086: entrypoint '_prog@XX' is not __stdcall with 12 bytes of arguments; image may not run\n\n\nWhen specifying your own DLL entrypoint, the linker is expecting a DllMain signature (which is 12 argument bytes and stdcall, so the function clears the arguments itself); officially it is:\n\nBOOL WINAPI DllMain(HINSTANCE hinstDLL, DWORD fdwReason, LPVOID lpvReserved)\n\n\nYou might implement the entrypoint function as shown in this version of prog.c:\n\n#include <Windows.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n#pragma warning (disable:4100) //Warning Level 4: unreferenced formal parameter\n\nint __stdcall prog(DWORD hInst, DWORD dwReason, DWORD dwReserved)\n{\n    printf(\"Result of memcmp: %d\\n\",memcmp(\"foo\",\"bar\",3));\n    return(1);\n}\n\n\nAssuming your LIB and INCLUDE environment variables are properly set, you can build the source above with the commands:\n\ncl.exe /nologo /c /MD /Fa./prog.asm prog.c\nlink.exe /nologo /dll /subsystem:console /entry:prog prog.obj kernel32.lib\n\n\nYou already know you can build the original C source with the C compiler.\nFocusing on the prog.asm output file generated from the /Fa option, you can build the DLL from the generated ASM source as follows:\n\nml.exe /c /coff /Cx prog.asm\nlink.exe /nologo /dll /subsystem:console /entry:prog prog.obj kernel32.lib\n\n\nTest out your DLL using a simple console loader such as:\n\n#include <Windows.h>\nint __cdecl main(void)\n{\n    HMODULE hLib = LoadLibrary(\"prog.dll\");\n    printf(\"LoadLibrary result: 0x%X / code=0x%X\\n\",hLib,GetLastError());\n}\n\n\nOn my machine, both the C and MASM generated DLLs produced the following output:\n\nResult of memcmp: 1\nLoadLibrary result: 0x10000000 / code=0x0\nResult of memcmp: 1\n\n\nThe generated MSVC 7.1 ASM file produced by the compiler is listed below for reference.

In the specific case of the Either type constructor (partially applied, in this case, to String), you can apply a function to a Right value, but ignore the function if applied to a Left value (your error). It provides a way of error propagation without having to check for the error.\n\nfmap f (Right x) = Right (f x)\nfmap f (Left y) = Left y\n\n\n\n\nAn applicative functor is similar, except the function itself can be wrapped just like the argument it is applied to. The <*> operator unwraps both its operands, unlike fmap which only unwraps its right operand.\n\nRight f <*> Right x = Right (f x)\nLeft f <*> _ = Left f\n_ <*> Left y = Left y\n\n\nTypically, you don't wrap functions yourself: they result from using fmap to partially apply a function to a wrapped value:\n\nfmap (+) (Right 3) == Right (+ 3)\nfmap (+) (Left \"error\") == Left \"error\"\n\n\nSo, when we are working with Either values, the use of <$> (infix fmap) and <*> let us pretend we are working with regular values, without worrying about whether they are wrapped with Left or Right. Right values provide the expected Right-wrapped answer, and Left values are preserved. In the case of a binary operator, only the first Left value is returned, but that is often sufficient.\n\n(+) <$> Left \"x undefined\" <*> Left \"y undefined\" == Left \"x undefined\" <*> Left \"y undefined\"\n                                                  == Left \"x undefined\"\n\n(+) <$> Left \"x undefined\" <*> Right 9 == Left \"x undefined\" <*> Right 9\n                                       == Left \"x undefined\"\n\n(+) <$> Right 3 <*> Left \"y undefined\" == Right (+ 3) <*> Left \"y undefined\"\n                                       == Left \"y undefined\"\n\n(+) <$> Right 3 <*> Right 9 == Right (+3) <*> Right 9\n                            == Right 12\n\n\n\n\nIn the end, using the Applicative instance of Either String lets us combine the results of evaluating two subexpressions without having to explicitly check if either recursive call of eval actually succeeded. Successful recursive calls result in success; an error in either call is used as the same error for the top-level call.\n    ","id":422,"PostTypeId":2,"PostId":421,"bounty":0.6968271870440064,"UserId":78,"upvoteCount":25},{"body":"\nThe <$> operator is an infix form of fmap.

I can live with differences up to the ~15th digit - this is machine precision. What troubles me is the 4th column. Here is where the nearly equal number subtraction comes into play and where we really see the discrepancies (rows 2-4 are negative of each other!)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor reference, here is my python code:\n\n\nA = [[1.,2.,3.,4.],[5.,6.,7.,8.],[9.,10.,11.,12.],[13.,14.,15.,16.]]\ntest = fctns.hess(A)\nprint(test)\n\ndef hess(A):\n# This function reduces any mxm matrix to Hessenberg form\n# through orthogonality similarity transforms.

The artwork is created in Sketch, and exported as a Swift class using the PaintCode plugin. Each class can be quite complex and lengthy, with a lot of data. The class file is then fed to an automated command-line tool that writes app-specific functionality in to the file, allowing the art to become interactive and flexible. The resulting Swift file is added to the app's Xcode project.\n\nAs Swift does not allow for Objective-C style dynamic loading/creation of classes by name (feel free to correct), my app adds the processed Swift class to a lookup table of drawing classes. When the app needs to draw a specific piece of artwork, the class lookup table is read, the relevant class is returned, and is then used to draw the art.\n\nI am concerned that this approach may not be viable once the project ramps up to full-scale production, at which point hundreds or thousands of classes will be generated.

These are exported as SVGs. The engine loads an SVG on-demand, parses it, and the mark-up is used to indicate/direct app-specific logic and drawing. Due to the amount of work involved, this is not viable for small numbers of art pieces -- stick to PaintCode instead -- but once done it allows a great amount of flexibility and speed, without all the Xcode and sourcekitservice crashes.\n\nThis approach allows the art assets to be wrangled like they normally are: grouped in folders, loaded-on-demand, cached, released etc.\n    ","title":"Handling Very Large Numbers of Swift Classes","id":473,"PostTypeId":1,"bounty":0.6643358144940348,"UserId":21,"viewCount":1,"upvoteCount":17,"comments":1},{"body":"\nI'm all for swift, but given the constraints you mention, objc is probably your tool for this type of task. Alternately you could come up with a scripting solution. A couple thoughts: \n\n\nYou should rasterize your art: Why'd you code it? The platform, and every technology you mention is an apple technology, it therefore helps to use their apps as guides: every apple app utilizes either built in controls, or an overwhelming number of rasterized graphics. (examples include: Logic Studio, Window Server (Aqua), garage band, Calendar, etc.) this is because bitmap manipulation is FAST. The millions of UIBeziers in your thousands of classes are a thousand times more complex and could trash your performance because all that math would have to be done on the cpu as opposed to simple bitmap stretches on the gpu. Apple has discussed this at length in cocoa sessions.\nThe Swift runtime isn't mature enough to handle code unloading. You can ostensibly call dlopen() on a swift dylib, and it should work, but it would be very different than working with real swift classes. Swift doesn't have the dynamicism to support this. You also can not call dlclose(). Apple's Swift Bug Tracker explicitly says dlclose is not supported. (In fact, they say they won't support it!)  So if you really have thousands of huge classes, once they're loaded, you wouldn't be able to reliably unload them. In swift, therefore you can't solve the problem like this.\nIf you insist on doing things this way, you ought to investigate offloading CGGraphicsContext work to other threads right from the get go, because you're going to have to manage quite a bit of work that is designed to happen on the main thread.

I'm trying to create a hierarchy of jpanels:\nHere's the hierarchy\n\nOpener\n  Mammal\n    Tiger\n      Tiger_caged //terminating button\n      Tiger_riding //terminating button\n  Reptile\n    Frog\n      Frog_eating //terminating button\n      Frog_null //terminating button\n\nThe initial jpanel is opener which is added to the JFrame on start up.\nOpener will have mammal and reptile.\nEach of those buttons, when clicked, will call swap(currentJPanel), which then calls removeall(), repaint(), and revalidate() then adds the next JPanel under them with x buttons, each which calls swap(currentJPanel) method.  This will continue until until you reach the terminating JPanel with buttons that, when clicked, does x action, and then calls reset() which asks if the user wants to continue the game or get the result.  If continue game is selected, then removeall(), repaint(), revalidate() and add opener again.\n\nI created a jPanel called content to place each of my JPanels in, added opener to content, and added content to the JFrame.  The buttons that are not in opener should not be added to the JFrame until a certain button is clicked.  Below is my current code.  When I run the gui, all of the buttons I have created are visible.  Only buttons Reptile and Mammal should be visible on startup.  Also, when one of the buttons are clicked, nothing is removed or added.  The only button that works currectly is the getResult button, which is the only one that doesn't call swap().  My initial thought is that I can't pass a jButton to a method but no error comes up when I call swap() so I'm not sure.

I'm guessing the value is stored little-endian, so you'd just do:\n\n nbtriangles = int.from_bytes(fichier.read(4), 'little')\n\n\nChange the second argument to 'big' if it's supposed to be big-endian.\n\nMind you, the normal way to parse a fixed width type is the struct module, but apparently you've ruled that out.\n\nFor the confusion over the repr, bytes objects will display ASCII printable characters (e.g. a) or standard ASCII escapes (e.g. \\t) if the byte value corresponds to one of them. If it doesn't, it uses \\x##, where ## is the hexadecimal representation of the byte value, so \\x90 represents the byte with value 0x90, or 144. You need to combine the byte values at offsets to reconstruct the int, but int.from_bytes does this for you faster than any hand-rolled solution could.\n\nUpdate: Since apparent int.from_bytes isn't \"basic\" enough, a couple more complex, but only using top-level built-ins (not alternate constructors) solutions. For little-endian, you can do this:\n\ndef int_from_bytes(inbytes):\n    res = 0\n    for i, b in enumerate(inbytes):\n        res |= b << (i * 8)  # Adjust each byte individually by 8 times position\n    return res\n\n\nYou can use the same solution for big-endian by adding reversed to the loop, making it enumerate(reversed(inbytes)), or you can use this alternative solution that handles the offset adjustment a different way:\n\ndef int_from_bytes(inbytes):\n    res = 0\n    for b in inbytes:\n        res <<= 8  # Adjust bytes seen so far to make room for new byte\n        res |= b   # Mask in new byte\n    return res\n\n\nAgain, this big-endian solution can trivially work for little-endian by looping over reversed(inbytes) instead of inbytes. In both cases inbytes[::-1] is an alternative to reversed(inbytes) (the former makes a new bytes in reversed order and iterates that, the latter iterates the existing bytes object in reverse, but unless it's a huge bytes object, enough to strain RAM if you copy it, the difference is pretty minimal).\n    ","id":507,"PostTypeId":2,"PostId":505,"bounty":0.822250089604095,"UserId":78,"upvoteCount":27},{"body":"\n\nI have a simple web app built using the angular CLI.
